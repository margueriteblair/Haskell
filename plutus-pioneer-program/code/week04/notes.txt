We'll be looking at IO as well:

public static int foo() {
    ... //example java code
}

... foo() .. foo() 

In Java code, the first and second call of foo can very well result in different integers.
There's no way to say that the first and second call are the same.

We'd say some "IO" happens in this Java code
