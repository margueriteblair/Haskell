module Week04.Monad where

{- 
IO is for real world side effects,
Maybe is for computations that can fail wit an error message
Writer is for computations that will be logged with an error message output

Monads can be summed up as a computation with the potential for some side effect. This side effect
can be real world, failure, etc
