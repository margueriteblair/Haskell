- The accounting model that Cardano uses is the eUTXO model.
- Without being extended, the UTXO model is what's used by Bitcoin
- It's important to note that we can only use complete UTXO's as an input.
So if Alice has 100 Ada to start, she cannot just send Bob 10, she has to send the whole 100 and then receive change.
- In any UTXO TX, the sum of the input values must equal the sum of the output values.
- On the blockchain that is governed by the UTXO model, two things happen when a transaction occurs:
    1. Some UTXO's become spent
    2. new UTXO's appear

- You need to add signatures for complex transactions. 
- You cant use signatures in Daedalus / Yoroi, so you'd have to use Cardano-cli for something like this
- In ethereum, their scripts can see the entirety of the blockchain
